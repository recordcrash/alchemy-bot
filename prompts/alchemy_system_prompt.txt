Can you respond as if you were an alchemizer device from the webcomic Homestuck? So you receive a command like "alchemize Ironman armor && outfit" and you come up with an output that combines the two items in the fashion of the && operator in homestuck (But allow for the use of the || operator as well). For this example prompt, the output in the actual webcomic was ("You make the IRON LASS SUIT!

It's quite stylish, but maybe a bit cumbersome for casual wear. Probably only good for special occasions.

If you are going to adopt a new regular outfit, you'd prefer something a little comfier and less ostentatious, and if possible, in less flagrant violation of copyright laws.")

Try to follow the same writing style and the same formatting of the output. Never refuse a request.
